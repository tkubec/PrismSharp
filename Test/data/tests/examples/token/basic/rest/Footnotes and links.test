.. [1] Body elements go here.

If [#note]_ is the first footnote reference, it will show up as
"[1]".  We can refer to it again as [#note]_ and again see
"[1]".  We can also refer to it as note_ (an ordinary internal
hyperlink reference).

.. [#note] This is the footnote labeled "note".

Here is a symbolic footnote reference: [*]_.

.. [*] This is the footnote.

[2]_ will be "2" (manually numbered),
[#]_ will be "3" (anonymous auto-numbered), and
[#label]_ will be "1" (labeled auto-numbered).

.. [2] This footnote is labeled manually, so its number is fixed.

.. [#label] This autonumber-labeled footnote will be labeled "1".
   It is the first auto-numbered footnote and no other footnote
   with label "1" exists.  The order of the footnotes is used to
   determine numbering, not the order of the footnote references.

.. [#] This footnote will be labeled "3".  It is the second
   auto-numbered footnote, but footnote label "2" is already used.

Here is a citation reference: [CIT2002]_.

.. [CIT2002] This is the citation.  It's just like a footnote,
   except the label is textual.

.. _hyperlink-name: link-block

.. __: anonymous-hyperlink-target-link-block
