* Lists are easy to do:
** start every line
* with a star
** more stars mean
*** deeper levels

# Numbered lists are good
## very organized
## easy to follow

; Definition lists
; item : definition
; semicolon plus term
: colon plus definition

* Or create mixed lists
*# and nest them
*#* like this
*#*; definitions
*#*: work:
*#*; apple
*#*; banana
*#*: fruits
